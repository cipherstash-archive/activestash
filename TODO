* Config
 - workspace or profile
 - keys etc
 - Add a config option to namespace collections
 - production settings

* Uniqueness validations

* Document and test the "all" index option

* Collection Schema
   - Detect changes and reindex (needs backend change)

* Rake tasks
 - list/delete use stash.rb

* Queries
 - Range queries
   - between
 - Ordering
 - String ordering
 - "all" index
 - check that chaining to create etc still works

-----------------------------

There is *never* any point in having both range and exact index types on a field.

Both types are a b-tree under the hood. Range is a semantic superset of exact.

If there's a range, there's no value in also having an exact index on the field and there are also a heap of downsides: more terms need to be transmitted to the backend.
